### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer working for the past 10 years.  

My professional background is in artificial intelligence. Iâ€™ve worked at Unbabel, a YC company, as an artificial intelligence engineer on the Machine learning team. I also have some interests in quantum computing, financial modeling and robotics. However, most recently Iâ€™ve been working on consumer hardware.
